# Angular Project with Server-JSON and Tailwind CSS

This is an Angular project that uses Server-JSON for fake data and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Server-JSON

This project uses Server-JSON to generate fake data for the application. The data is stored in the `assets/data/` directory. To generate new data, run `npm run generate-data`.
to use it : `json-server --watch db.json`.

## Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To customize the styling, edit the `src/styles.css` file.

Sure, here's an example of what you could include in the README file for your Angular project to explain bindings, directives, and services:

## Bindings

Angular provides several ways to create bindings between components and templates. Bindings are a way to pass data from a component to a template or from a template to a component. Some common types of bindings include:

- Interpolation: {{ expression }}
- Property binding: [property]="expression"
- Event binding: (event)="handler"
- Two-way binding: [(ngModel)]="property"

## Directives

Directives are a way to attach behavior to elements in the DOM. Angular provides several built-in directives, including ngIf, ngFor, and ngSwitch. You can also create your own custom directives.

To use a directive, you apply it to an element in the template. For example:

```html
<div *ngIf="showElement">
  This element will only be displayed if showElement is true.
</div>
```

## Services

Services are a way to share data and functionality between components. Services are typically used for things like fetching data from a server, caching data, or sharing state between components.

To use a service, you first create it using the Angular CLI:

```
ng generate service my-service
```

Then, you can inject the service into a component using the constructor:

```typescript
import { MyService } from "./my-service.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-component",
  templateUrl: "./my-component.component.html",
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
}
```

For more information on services, see the [official Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services).
